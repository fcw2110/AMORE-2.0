Three sets of isoprene mechanisms. 
One with rate constant optimization but no stiffness reduction, 
one with rate constant optimization and stiffness reduction, 
one with stiffness reduction but no rate constant optimization.

The numbers correspond to the desired number of species set in the inputs to the algorithm.
The numbers reported in the paper are lower because the number here includes non-isoprene species 
which are not counted. The 42 species mechanism corresponds to the 15 species mechanism reported
in the paper. 135, and 100 here are the 109 and 74 species mechanisms from the paper.
